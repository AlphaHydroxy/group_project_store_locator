Store Finder

Global pub giant Withoutaspoon, wants a pub finder that allows users to "Find your nearest store" for their website.

User can enter their postcode or town or street name and get a list of the venues within 3 miles, and a map showing all of the venues. Each has a distance, address, phone number, opening hours and a list of facilities and services (e.g. cash machine, car parking).
